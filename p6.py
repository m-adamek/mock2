# (p6.py) Define a function f(years, course, average_grade) that, 
# for the j file, returns the number of students who are at least 
# the given number of years and have a grade average of at least 
# average_grade in the given course name.
# 
# Example:
# f(21, "statistics", 4) ïƒ  compare your result with other students
